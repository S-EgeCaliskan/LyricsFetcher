# LyricsFetcher

Developed by Salim Ege Caliskan.

LyricsFetcher is a small project I did scraping the website called azlyrics.com.

The idea behind the program is to reduce the time spend searching for lyrics on the internet by scraping azlyrics through user input.
The user simply runs the program, enters the song name and/or artist's name, then is provided with a list to choose from as given on azlyrics' search engine.
The user then gives an input ranging from 1 to 5, and is provided with the lyrics of their selected song.

Learnings: I better understood the process of webscraping, and how to search which element I need on a given website, and make a useable program using webscraping effectively.
